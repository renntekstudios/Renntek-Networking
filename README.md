## RennTek Networking
The RennTek Network is a cross platform network API meant to be an easy-to-use solution for all developers.

## Currently supported client languages:

## How to use RennTek Networking
### The server...
All RennTek Networking servers are hosted by RennTek themselves,
   if you want to host yourself contact us and provide enough
   details about why you can't use our services
   
### The client...
#### C&#35;
The client namespace is entirely within RTNet, which means you'll
   have to be `using RTNet;` before accessing any of the client functions
   
In the simplest form, a client could be made of
```cs
using RTNet;

static void Main(string[] args)
{
   RTClient client = new RTClient("127.0.0.1", 4434);
   while(client.isConnected)
      System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10); // let the console sleep, the client is in another thread
   // Get rid of any resources the client is using
   client.Dispose();
}
```
