## How to use RennTek Networking
### The server...
All RennTek Networking servers are hosted by RennTek themselves,
   if you want to host one yourself contact us and provide a thorough description
   as to why we can trust you, along with any relevant proof or projects
   
### The client...
#### C&#35;
The client namespace is entirely within RTNet, which means you'll
   have to be `using RTNet;` before accessing any of the client functions
   
In the simplest form, a client could be made of
```cs
using RTNet;
using System;

static void Main(string[] args)
{
   RTClient client = new RTClient("127.0.0.1", 4434); // Connect to 127.0.0.1:4434
   while(client.isConnected)
   {
     string line = Console.ReadLine();
     if(line.ToLower() == "quit")
       break;
   }
   client.Dispose(); //Get rid of any resources the client is using
}
```
